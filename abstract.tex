for the deployment of computers and systems in small businesses associated with the use of web systems. Then, to evaluate the product in a 
development in the real world, the device and its implementation were evaluated, and was designed a case study of their deployment, which made it possible 
conclusions on the use of new technology in small organizations. \\
